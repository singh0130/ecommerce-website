                Formula One (also known as Formula 1 or F1) is the highest class of international racing for open-wheel
                 single-seater formula racing cars sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA).
                  The World Drivers' Championship, which became the FIA Formula One World Championship in 1981, has been 
                  one of the premier forms of racing around the world since its inaugural season in 1950. A Formula One season
                   consists of a series of races, known as Grands Prix, which take place worldwide on both purpose-built circuits 
                   and closed public roads.

                Formula One cars are the fastest regulated road-course racing cars in the world, owing to very high cornering 
                speeds achieved through the generation of large amounts of aerodynamic downforce. The cars underwent major changes 
                in 2017, allowing wider front and rear wings, and wider tyres, resulting top speeds of around 350 km/h (215 mph). 
                The cars are dependent on electronics and aerodynamics, suspension and tyres.
